The following C functions are for the poject binary_trees for the lower level programming curriculum of ALX, inside it contains the following C functions:


* A function that creates a binary tree node
* A function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
* A function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node
* A function that deletes an entire binary tree
* A function that checks if a node is a leaf
* A function that checks if a given node is a root
* A function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal
* A function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal
* A function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal
* A function that measures the height of a binary tree
* A function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree
* A function that measures the size of a binary tree
* A function that counts the leaves in a binary tree
